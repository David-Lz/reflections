How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
- To see the lines of the code where changes were made and catching typos


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
- Because there is a record of the evolution of the files along the time


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
- Manually choosing a commit offers the advantage of having a control that makes sense in the context of the situation but it could be subjective along every person or organization


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
- In programming there are files that usually are interrelated


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
- The first command is useful to see the messages related with changes and the second command to view the difference between codes


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
- Enables the feature of going back to previos versions of files


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
- To learn more about control version
